## Introduction

A framework for building GraphQL APIs without defining any kind of schema.
It reduces the time spent on writing and maintaining API definitions, allowing you to focus solely on writing your service logic.

## Why

We believe that the current approach to building APIs is outdated. Writing and maintaining API definitions is time-consuming and error-prone. When you already have TypeScript definitions, why not use them to infer the API schema? Pylon does exactly that.

Pylon also provides a set of tools to help you build, test, and deploy your APIs. We believe that building services should be easy and fun. Major functionalities like authentication, authorization, and context management are built-in, so you can focus on what matters most: your service logic.

With Pylon, you can build APIs faster, with fewer errors, and with less code.

## Create

To create a new Pylon project, run the following command:

```bash
npm create pylon
```

Afterwards, you can navigate to the newly created project and start the development server:

```bash
cd my-pylon
npm run dev
```

This will start the development server on `http://localhost:3000`.

Open the [Pylon Playground](https://pylon.cronit.io/docs/getting-started#built-in-graphql-playground) in your browser and start building your API.

## Develop

Update your service logic in the `src` directory.

```typescript
import {app} from '@getcronit/pylon'

export const graphql = {
  Query: {
    sum: (a: number, b: number) => {
      console.log(`Calculating sum of ${a} and ${b}`)
      return a + b
    }
  },
  Mutation: {
    divide: (a: number, b: number) => {
      if (b === 0) {
        console.error('Attempt to divide by zero')
        throw new Error('Division by zero is not allowed')
      }
      console.log(`Dividing ${a} by ${b}`)
      return a / b
    }
  }
}

export default app
```

## Deploy

Pylon is fully compatible with Cloudflare Workers, allowing you to deploy your service to the edge in just one minute.
Watch the video below to see how easy it is to deploy a Pylon.

If you prefer to deploy your service to a different platform, you can use the provided Dockerfile to build a Docker image and deploy it to your favorite cloud provider.

```bash
docker build -t my-pylon .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-pylon
```

## Runtimes

Designed to be flexible, Pylon can be run on various platforms, including:

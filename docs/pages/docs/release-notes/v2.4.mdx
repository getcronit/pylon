# v2.4 Release Notes

Welcome to `@getcronit/pylon@2.4.0` release (November 2024)!

Pylon v2.4 introduces full support for [Envelop plugins](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/envelop/plugins), significantly enhancing the extensibility and customization options for your GraphQL server.

## Envelop Plugin Support

- **Full Integration**: Pylon now supports all plugins from the Envelop ecosystem, developed by [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev/).
- **Easy Configuration**: Seamlessly add Envelop plugins to your Pylon application using the `plugins` array in your configuration.
- **Enhanced Functionality**: Easily extend your GraphQL server with features like custom error handling, caching, and more.

# Usage Example

Here's a quick example of how you can use an Envelop plugin in your Pylon application:

```ts
import {app, PylonConfig, ServiceError} from '@getcronit/pylon'
import {useErrorHandler} from '@envelop/core'

export const graphql = {
  Query: {
    hello: () => {
      throw new ServiceError('Hello, world!', {
        code: 'HELLO_WORLD',
        statusCode: 400
      })
    }
  },
  Mutation: {}
}

export const config: PylonConfig = {
  plugins: [
    useErrorHandler(({errors, context, phase}) => {
      console.error(errors)
    })
  ]
}

export default app
```

In this example, we're using the `useErrorHandler` plugin from Envelop to customize error handling in our GraphQL server.

## Benefits

By leveraging Envelop plugins, you can now:

1. Extend your GraphQL server's functionality without writing complex custom code.
2. Take advantage of battle-tested plugins maintained by the GraphQL community.
3. Easily add features like error handling, caching, authentication, and more.
4. Keep your Pylon application modular and easy to maintain.

## Documentation

We're excited to see what you'll build with these new capabilities! As always, we welcome your feedback and contributions.

## Example Project

To help you get started, we've created an [example project](https://github.com/getcronit/tree/main/examples/envelop-plugins) that demonstrates how to use Envelop plugins with Pylon. Feel free to explore the code and experiment with different plugins.

# Type Safety and Type Integration

Delve into the robust type safety features of Pylon, ensuring your codebase remains reliable and maintainable through tight integration with TypeScript.

## Overview

Pylon leverages TypeScript's powerful type system to provide robust type safety and seamless type integration for your web services. This ensures your services are reliable and maintainable.
By using TypeScript's various type variants, you can define rich and complex data structures, which are then automatically translated into corresponding GraphQL types by Pylon.

## Supported Type Variants

Pylon supports various TypeScript type variants, including interfaces, classes, types, functions, and enums. This allows you to define rich and complex type structures in your services.

<Callout type="note" title="Note">
  Almost all TypeScript type variants are supported in Pylon, even from external
  libraries.
</Callout>

## Defining a Service

Hereâ€™s an example of how to define a Pylon service using different TypeScript type variants:

```typescript
import {app} from '@getcronit/pylon'

// Define a type
type Address = {
  street: string
  city: string
  zipCode: string
}

// Define an interface
interface User {
  id: number
  name: string
  age: number
  address: Address
}

// Define an enum
enum Status {
  ACTIVE = 'ACTIVE',
  INACTIVE = 'INACTIVE'
}

// Define a class
class Product {
  constructor(public id: number, public name: string, public price: number) {}
}

export const graphql = {
  Query: {
    getUser: (id: number): User => {
      return {
        id,
        name: 'John Doe',
        age: 25,
        address: {street: '123 Main St', city: 'Anytown', zipCode: '12345'}
      }
    },
    getProduct: (id: number): Product => {
      return new Product(id, 'Example Product', 99.99)
    },
    getStatus: (): Status => {
      return Status.ACTIVE
    }
  },
  Mutation: {
    updateUser: (user: User): User => {
      return {...user, name: 'Updated Name'}
    },
    updateProduct: (product: Product): Product => {
      product.price = 79.99
      return product
    }
  }
}

export default app
```

## TypeScript Types in Pylon

1. **Primitives**: Define primitives such as `string`, `number`, and `boolean`.

   ```typescript
   const name: string = 'John Doe'
   const age: number = 25
   const isActive: boolean = true
   ```

   - **Automatic Mapping**: In Pylon, `string` and `boolean` types are automatically mapped to their GraphQL counterparts.
   - For `number` types, Pylon introduces a new scalar called `Number` to represent both integers and floating-point numbers. This distinction is necessary because TypeScript does not differentiate between integers and floating-point numbers, while GraphQL does.

   If you want to represent `ID`, `Int`, or `Float`, you must use the respective types from Pylon:

   ```typescript
   import {ID, Int, Float} from '@getcronit/pylon'

   const id: ID = '1'
   const int: Int = 42
   const float: Float = 3.14
   ```

2. **Types**: Define aliases for your object structures using `type` to create flexible and reusable type definitions.

   ```typescript
   type Address = {
     street: string
     city: string
     zipCode: string
   }
   ```

3. **Interfaces**: Define the shape of your objects using interfaces. This ensures consistent structure across your application.

   ```typescript
   interface User {
     id: number
     name: string
     age: number
     address: Address
   }
   ```

4. **Classes**: Use classes to create object instances with properties and methods.

   ```typescript
   class Product {
     constructor(
       public id: number,
       public name: string,
       public price: number
     ) {}
   }
   ```

5. **Static Functions**: Define static functions within classes to encapsulate logic related to the class.

   ```typescript
   class Product {
     constructor(
       public id: number,
       public name: string,
       public price: number
     ) {}

     static fromJSON(json: string): Product {
       const data = JSON.parse(json)
       return new Product(data.id, data.name, data.price)
     }
   }
   ```

6. **Enums**: Define a set of named constants with enums, which are useful for representing a fixed set of related values.

   ```typescript
   enum Status {
     ACTIVE = 'ACTIVE',
     INACTIVE = 'INACTIVE'
   }
   ```

7. **Functions**: Leverage TypeScript's type annotations in your functions to ensure type safety for parameters and return values.

   ```typescript
   const getUser = (id: number): User => {
     return {
       id,
       name: 'John Doe',
       age: 25,
       address: {street: '123 Main St', city: 'Anytown', zipCode: '12345'}
     }
   }
   ```

## GraphQL Integration

Pylon translates these TypeScript definitions into corresponding GraphQL types:

- **Types and Interfaces**: Both are mapped to GraphQL object types.
- **Unions**: Represented as GraphQL union types.
- **Enums**: Mapped directly to GraphQL enums.
- **Classes**: Mapped to GraphQL object types, similar to interfaces and types.
- **Functions**: Used to define the resolver logic for your queries and mutations, with TypeScript types ensuring the correctness of inputs and outputs.

## Type Variants and GraphQL

- **Union Input Types**: Currently, GraphQL does not support union input types, so they cannot be used in Pylon.

  ```typescript
  type UserInput = {
    id: number
    name: string
  }

  type ProductInput = {
    id: number
    price: number
  }

  type Input = UserInput | ProductInput

  // This will not work in Pylon

  export const graphql = {
    Mutation: {
      update: (input: Input) => {
        // Example implementation

        return 'Success'
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Union Output Types**: Supported by GraphQL but do not yet create an interface in Pylon. They can still be defined to return multiple types, though their integration might be limited.

  ```typescript
  type User = {
    id: number
    name: string
  }

  type Product = {
    id: number
    price: number
  }

  type Output = User | Product

  export const graphql = {
    Query: {
      get: (): Output => {
        // Example implementation

        return {id: 1, name: 'John Doe'}
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Intersection Types**: Supported by GraphQL and can be used in Pylon. They can be used to define more complex types by combining multiple types.

  ```typescript
  type User = {
    id: number
    name: string
  }

  type Address = {
    street: string
    city: string
  }

  type UserWithAddress = User & Address

  export const graphql = {
    Query: {
      getUserWithAddress: (): UserWithAddress => {
        // Example implementation

        return {
          id: 1,
          name: 'John Doe',
          street: '123 Main St',
          city: 'Anytown'
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Recursive Types**: Supported by GraphQL and can be used in Pylon. They can be used to define recursive data structures.

  ```typescript
  type Node = {
    id: number
    children: Node[]
  }

  export const graphql = {
    Query: {
      getNode: (): Node => {
        // Example implementation

        return {id: 1, children: [{id: 2, children: []}]}
      }
    }
  }
  ```

- **Type Assertions**: TypeScript type assertions can be used to override the inferred type of an expression. This can be useful when the type system cannot infer the correct type.

  ```typescript
  const data: any = {id: 1, name: 'John Doe'}

  const user = data as User

  export const graphql = {
    Query: {
      getUser: (): User => {
        // Example implementation

        return user
      }
    }
  }
  ```

* **Type Inference**: Pylon leverages TypeScript's powerful type inference capabilities to automatically infer types where possible. This reduces the need for explicit type annotations and makes your code more concise.

  ```typescript
  export const graphql = {
    Query: {
      getUser: () => {
        // Example implementation

        return {
          id: 1,
          name: 'John Doe',
          age: 25,
          address: {street: '123 Main St', city: 'Anytown', zipCode: '12345'},
          posts: (query: string) => {
            // Example implementation
            return [
              {id: 1, title: 'Post 1'},
              {id: 2, title: 'Post 2'},
              {
                id: 3,
                title: 'Post 3',
                data: async () => {
                  // Fetch the data from an external API

                  const response = await fetch(
                    'https://api.example.com/posts/3'
                  )
                  const data = await response.json()

                  return data
                }
              }
            ]
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
  ```

## Example in Action

### GraphQL Query Example

To use the `getUser` function, you would run a GraphQL query like this:

```graphql
query {
  getUser(id: 1) {
    id
    name
    age
    address {
      street
      city
      zipCode
    }
  }
}
```

The result would be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "getUser": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "John Doe",
      "age": 25,
      "address": {
        "street": "123 Main St",
        "city": "Anytown",
        "zipCode": "12345"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### GraphQL Mutation Example

To use the `updateUser` function, you would run a GraphQL mutation like this:

```graphql
mutation {
  updateUser(
    user: {
      id: 1
      name: "Jane Doe"
      age: 30
      address: {street: "456 Elm St", city: "Othertown", zipCode: "67890"}
    }
  ) {
    id
    name
    age
    address {
      street
      city
      zipCode
    }
  }
}
```

The result would be:

```json
{
  "data": {
    "updateUser": {
      "id": 1,
      "name": "Updated Name",
      "age": 30,
      "address": {
        "street": "456 Elm St",
        "city": "Othertown",
        "zipCode": "67890"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Hiding Fields

Often, you may want to hide certain fields from the GraphQL schema. This can be achieved by using TypeScript's `private` access modifier for class properties or by using the `Omit` utility type to exclude fields from an object type.

### Hiding Fields in Classes

To hide fields in classes, you can use the `private` or prefix the field with eather `$` or `#` to make it private.

```typescript
class Product {
  constructor(public id: number, public name: string, private price: number) {}
}
```

In this example, the `price` field is private and will not be exposed in the GraphQL schema.

### Hiding Fields in Object Types

To hide fields in object types, you can use the `Omit` utility type to exclude fields from the object type.

```typescript
type User = {
  id: number
  name: string
  age: number
}

type UserWithoutAge = Omit<User, 'age'>
```

In this example, the `UserWithoutAge` type excludes the `age` field from the `User` type.

### When to use `private` vs. `Omit` vs. `#` vs. `$`

- **`private`**: The `private` keyword is a compile-time check that prevents access to the field outside the class. Use this when you want to hide fields in classes and exclude them from the GraphQL schema.
- **`Omit`**: Use the `Omit` utility type when you want to exclude fields from an object type. This is useful when you want to hide fields in object types and exclude them from the GraphQL schema.
- **`#`**: Similar to `private`, the `#` prefix makes a field private to the class (runtime). Use this when you want to hide fields in classes and exclude them from the GraphQL schema.
- **`$`**: Use this when you don't want to expose a field in the GraphQL schema but still want to access it within your code.

## Conclusion

Pylon's integration with TypeScript ensures that your web services are type-safe and seamlessly integrated with GraphQL. By using TypeScript's various type variants, you can define rich and complex data structures, making your services robust and maintainable.

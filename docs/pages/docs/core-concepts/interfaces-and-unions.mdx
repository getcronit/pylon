# Interfaces and Unions in Pylon

Pylon fully supports TypeScript interfaces and unions, providing a seamless way to define complex types and relationships in your GraphQL API. This feature automatically translates TypeScript interfaces and unions into corresponding GraphQL schemas, simplifying the development process and enhancing type safety.

## Interfaces

In Pylon, TypeScript interfaces are automatically translated into GraphQL interfaces. This allows you to define common fields that a set of types must include.

### Basic Interface Example

```typescript
import {app, ID} from '@getcronit/pylon'

interface Node {
  id: ID
}

interface User extends Node {
  name: string
}

interface Post extends Node {
  title: string
}

export const graphql = {
  Query: {
    user: (id: ID): User => {
      // Implementation
    },
    post: (id: ID): Post => {
      // Implementation
    },
    node: (id: ID): Node => {
      // Implementation
    }
  }
}

export default app
```

This TypeScript code generates the following GraphQL schema:

```graphql
interface Node {
  id: ID!
}

type User implements Node {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}

type Post implements Node {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}

type Query {
  user(id: ID!): User
  post(id: ID!): Post
  node(id: ID!): Node
}
```

### Using Interfaces

Interfaces are particularly useful when you have a set of types that share common fields. For example, you might have different types of content (posts, comments, pages) that all have an ID and a creation date:

```typescript
interface Content {
  id: ID
  createdAt: Date
}

interface Post extends Content {
  title: string
  body: string
}

interface Comment extends Content {
  text: string
  author: string
}

interface Page extends Content {
  title: string
  slug: string
}
```

This structure allows you to create queries that can return any type of content:

```typescript
export const graphql = {
  Query: {
    getContent: (id: ID): Content => {
      // Implementation to fetch any type of content
    }
  }
}
```

## Unions

Unions in TypeScript are translated into GraphQL union types. They allow you to define a type that could be one of several types.

### Basic Union Example

```typescript
type SearchResult = User | Post

export const graphql = {
  Query: {
    search: (query: string): SearchResult[] => {
      // Implementation to search users and posts
    }
  }
}
```

This generates the following GraphQL schema:

```graphql
union SearchResult = User | Post

type Query {
  search(query: String!): [SearchResult!]
}
```

### Using Unions

Unions are great for representing results that could be of different types. For example, a newsfeed that contains different types of items:

```typescript
type Status = {
  id: ID
  text: string
  author: User
}

type Photo = {
  id: ID
  url: string
  caption: string
}

type NewsfeedItem = Status | Photo

export const graphql = {
  Query: {
    newsfeed: (): NewsfeedItem[] => {
      // Implementation to fetch newsfeed items
    }
  }
}
```

## Automatic Type Resolution

One of the key features of Pylon's interface and union support is automatic type resolution. Unlike other GraphQL servers that require manual implementation of a `__resolveType` function, Pylon automatically resolves the correct type based on the shape of your data.

This means you don't need to write code like this:

```typescript
// This is NOT needed in Pylon
const resolveType = {
  SearchResult: {
    __resolveType(obj) {
      if (obj.name) return 'User'
      if (obj.title) return 'Post'
      return null
    }
  }
}
```

Pylon handles this automatically, simplifying your code and reducing the potential for errors.

## Shared Properties

When you define a union type where the member types have shared properties, Pylon automatically creates an interface for these shared properties.

### Example

```typescript
type Bar = {
  id: ID
  title: string
}

type Foo = {
  id: ID
  name: string
}

type Example = Foo | Bar
```

This generates the following GraphQL schema:

```graphql
interface Example {
  id: ID!
}

type Foo implements Example {
  id: ID!
  name: String!
}

type Bar implements Example {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
}
```

This feature helps to maintain type safety and allows for more efficient querying of common properties.

## Multiple Interfaces

Pylon supports implementing multiple interfaces, mirroring the GraphQL specification. This allows for complex type hierarchies and flexible schema design.

### Example

```typescript
interface Timestamped {
  createdAt: Date
  updatedAt: Date
}

interface Authored {
  author: User
}

class BlogPost implements Node, Timestamped, Authored {
  constructor(
    public id: ID,
    public title: string,
    public createdAt: Date,
    public updatedAt: Date,
    public author: User
  ) {}
}
```

This will generate a GraphQL type that implements all three interfaces:

```graphql
type BlogPost implements Node & Timestamped & Authored {
  id: ID!
  title: String!
  createdAt: DateTime!
  updatedAt: DateTime!
  author: User!
}
```

## Type Inference

Pylon's type inference capabilities allow it to generate appropriate GraphQL schemas even from simple object structures. This means you can often define your types implicitly through your data structures.

### Example

```typescript
const nodes = [
  {
    id: '1',
    name: 'John Doe'
  },
  {
    id: '4',
    title: 'Hello, Pylon!'
  }
]

export const graphql = {
  Query: {
    node: (id: ID) => {
      return nodes.find(node => node.id === id)
    }
  }
}
```

Pylon will automatically generate an interface and two types with generated names based on the structure of the `nodes` array. This can be particularly useful for rapid prototyping or when working with existing data structures.

## Best Practices

When working with interfaces and unions in Pylon, consider the following best practices:

1. **Use interfaces for shared fields**: If you have types that share common fields, define an interface to represent these shared fields. This makes your schema more maintainable and allows for more efficient querying.
2. **Use unions for heterogeneous collections**: When you have fields that can return different types of objects, use unions to represent this. This provides clear type information to API consumers.
3. **Leverage automatic type resolution**: Trust Pylon's automatic type resolution instead of manually implementing `__resolveType` functions. This reduces boilerplate and potential errors.
4. **Be consistent with naming**: Use clear and consistent naming conventions for your interfaces and unions. This makes your schema more understandable and self-documenting.
5. **Use type inference judiciously**: While Pylon's type inference is powerful, explicitly defining your types can often lead to clearer, more maintainable code, especially in larger projects.
6. **Consider performance**: Remember that using interfaces and unions can sometimes lead to less efficient queries if not used carefully. Monitor your API's performance and optimize as necessary.

## Conclusion

Pylon's support for interfaces and unions brings the full power of TypeScript's type system to your GraphQL API. By automatically translating TypeScript interfaces and unions into GraphQL schemas, Pylon simplifies the process of defining complex types and relationships.

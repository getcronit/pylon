We will start with a simple setup using in-memory data ([In-Memory Setup](./in-memory-setup.mdx)) and them move on to communicate with an external API ([External APIs](./external-apis)) and finally use Prisma to interact with a database ([Integrating Prisma](./integrating-prisma)).

## Set Up Your Pylon Service

If you haven't already, you can set up your Pylon service by following the [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started) guide.

This guilde will use `Bun` as the runtime environment, but you can use any other runtime environment that supports Pylon without any issues.
